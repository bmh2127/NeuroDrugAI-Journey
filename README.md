## About Me 👨‍🔬

My journey to AI-driven drug discovery represents a natural evolution of my interdisciplinary background. Beginning as a therapist, I recognized the limitations in psychiatric diagnosis and sought deeper understanding through neuroscience. This led me to neuroimaging, where I developed expertise across multiple modalities (MRI, fMRI, MRS, EEG, fNIRS) - giving me a multidimensional understanding of neural activity.

### Career Evolution 📈

My career has followed a path of increasing technical sophistication:
- From basic image analysis to advanced programming
- Managing complex research studies involving diverse imaging techniques
- Implementing sophisticated AI models for biological data analysis
- Leading the analysis department at LifeCanvas Technologies

At LifeCanvas, I created end-to-end analysis software for customers, developed ETL pipelines for massive biological datasets, improved cell detection models, and built model training pipelines adaptable to diverse biological contexts. This experience handling the complexity of large biological datasets directly addresses challenges faced in computational drug discovery.

## Project Purpose 🎯

This repository documents my journey learning AI-driven small molecule discovery, with a focus on applying my neuroscience background to CNS-targeted therapeutics. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of neural circuit modeling and molecular interactions - a perspective that brings together my understanding of both macro-level brain function and micro-level biological processes.

## Learning Goals 📚

1. Master fundamental concepts in cheminformatics and molecular representation
2. Implement and understand graph neural networks for molecular property prediction
3. Develop generative models for novel molecule creation
4. Build a lightweight RAG system to enhance my learning process
5. Create projects that demonstrate the intersection of neuroscience and drug discovery
6. Document my entire learning journey for others with similar backgrounds
