# Molecular Concept Learning Protocol

## My Background Context
I am a neuroscientist transitioning to AI/ML for small molecule discovery. I have experience with:
- Neuroimaging (MRI, fMRI, MRS, EEG, fNIRS) 
- Neural circuit modeling
- Machine learning for biological data
- ETL pipelines for large biological datasets
- Cell detection models

## Query Format
[CONCEPT]: [The molecular concept I need to understand]
[RELATION]: [How this might relate to CNS drug targets or neuroscience]

## Desired Output Format
1. **Basic Definition**: Clear, concise explanation of the concept
2. **Neuroscience Connection**: How this relates to my background
3. **Practical Application**: How this concept is used in small molecule discovery
4. **Learning Resources**: 2-3 specific resources to learn more (papers, tutorials, tools)
5. **Code Example**: A minimal Python snippet demonstrating the concept (if applicable)

## Output Constraints
- Use analogies to neural systems when possible
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Prioritize CNS-related examples when relevant
- Keep examples concise and focused
