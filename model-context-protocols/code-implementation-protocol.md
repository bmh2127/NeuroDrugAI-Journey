# Code Implementation Protocol

## My Current Technical Context
- Proficient in Python
- Experienced with machine learning frameworks
- Familiar with biological data processing
- Background in neural imaging and analysis
- Learning molecular representation and cheminformatics

## Query Format
[ALGORITHM/TECHNIQUE]: [What I need to implement]
[PURPOSE]: [What problem this solves]
[CONSTRAINTS]: [Any specific requirements or limitations]

## Desired Output Format
1. **Implementation Strategy**: High-level approach before coding
2. **Required Libraries**: What packages I'll need
3. **Code Implementation**: Well-commented Python code
4. **Usage Example**: How to apply this to small molecule data
5. **Testing Approach**: How to verify the implementation works
6. **Potential Pitfalls**: Common issues to watch for

## Output Constraints
- Provide type hints in function definitions
- Include docstrings with parameters and return types
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Optimize for readability over clever solutions
- Reference specific cheminformatics concepts where relevant
